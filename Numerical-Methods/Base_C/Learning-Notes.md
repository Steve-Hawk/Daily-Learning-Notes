# **Numerical Methods (C++)**
-------------------------
**This is a documentation for learing numerical methods mainly on the programming language of C++**

-------------------------
## **Chapter 1 --- Basic Knowledge**
### **Significant Figure**
> * **Number with no digits :** For example, 13040 has four significant figures
> * **Number with digits :** For example,2100.5 has five significant figures, but 0.015 has two significant figures

>**Tips:** 
>> * *Great care should be attached, especially when we solve the problem of obtaining the inverse matrix which contains fractional number*
>> * *data type double should be used as far as possible to get a high acurracy, even a standard in numerical computing*

### **Rules in Arithmetic Computing**
> Always consider the least position behind the digit

>**Tips:**
>> *When computing the summation of series, we should take care of the stationary condition, in order to avoid reduce the related error*
